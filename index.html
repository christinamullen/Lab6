                    organizer
                    for Viking Hacks Hackathon. Viking Hacks is an annual hackathon run by the GDSC club at Diablo
                    Valley
                    College. The 2023
                    theme was sustainability. The participants were challenged to create projects that helped save the
                    planet -in just
                    48 hours! Seeing the participants creatively come together to make cool products was a major 2023
                    highlight! We had an amazing team to help produce the event. Here are some of our memories.</p>
