        <p>Hey! I'm Christina, Interface Designer and Developer. In 2023, I was the lead organizer for Viking Hacks
            Hackathon. Viking Hacks is an annual hackathon run by the GDSC club at Diablo Valley College. The 2023 theme
            was
            sustainability. The participants were challenged to create projects that helped save the planet -in just 48
            hours! Seeing the participants creatively come together to make cool products was a major 2023
            highlight! We had an amazing team to help produce the event. Here are some of our memories.</p>
